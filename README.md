# AnalyticProphet

Analytic implementation of Facebook Prophet.

Prophet's a time series forecasting algorithm published by Facebook Core Data Science Team back in 2017. It gained popularity since then and several companies reported using it.

A successor - NeuralProphet - wad released in 2021, but it's out of the scope of this repo :)

Prophet model is a Generalized Additive Model (GAM) composed of 3 components, is defined as follows


$ \displaystyle
y(t) = g(t) + s(t) + h(t) + \epsilon_t \\
g(t) = (k + a(t)^T\delta)t + (m+a(t)^T\gamma) \\
s(t) = \sum_n a_n \cos(\frac{2\pi tn}{P}) + b_n \sin(\frac{2\pi tn}{P}) = X(t)^T\beta \\
h(t) = \sum_i \kappa_i \mathcal{1}_{t \in D_i} = Z(t)^T\kappa
$

where $g, s, h$ represents respectively the trend, seasonality and holidays components, further details are provided in the Prophet official paper.

Prophet's trained udner Maximum A Posteriori - meaning priors are declared on the parameters, likelihood is declared on the data, and a function - posterior distribution - is now well-defined, using Bayes formula.


The original version of Prophet is no more than the L-BFGS optimization algorithm used on the loss function. The gradient being estimated using Automatic Differentiation - the L-BFGS optimizer as well as the Automatic Differentiaiton feature are defined within Stan, which itself is written upon C++ and relies on the `eigen` library.

In this implementaiton, the same optimizer is used on the same loss, however, no gradient estimation part, instead, the gradient is provided by an analytical expression. The backend is written in C++, using `dlib` for L-BFGS and `eigen` for numerical computations, An interface similar to the original Prophet is provided.
